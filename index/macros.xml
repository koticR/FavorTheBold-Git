<!--
    Here we tell the game where to look for our general galaxy, cluster, sector, zones & region setup.
    The wildcard (*) is not needed but helps us saving time since we don't need to define every single sector one by one.
    Make sure that that everything before the wildcard is distinguishable by you and the game.
    Word of encouragement. Setting up a galaxy and/or sectors can be massively confusing since there is a lot of back and forth between the files!
    Don't give up you will get it to work.
